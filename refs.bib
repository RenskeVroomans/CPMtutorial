  abstract = {The biophysical characteristics of cells determine the shape of individual
	cells and their packing within tissues. Cells that are unconstrained
	by cell walls can be mobile, form regular or irregular epithelial
	structures, round-up and form clusters, or deform and attach to substrates.
	All those shape changes are a consequence of internal cytoskeletal
	processes, such as actin polymerisation and myosin contractility
	of the cortex, adhesion molecules within the cell membrane that interact
	with substrates and neighbouring cells, and processes which regulate
	the cell volume. Such basic biological principles, when combined,
	are able to unleash a rich variety of cellular behaviour that is
	not readily understandable without a theoretical framework. It is
	a challenge for both developmental and cell biology to be able to
	comprehend how subcellular regulatory processes aect the cell mechanics
	and, importantly, how these cell properties then determine the shape
	as well as tissue topology. We here present a mathematical analysis
	of a commonly used class of model formalisms that describe cell surface
	mechanics using an energy-based approach. The analytical study reveals
	the complete possible spectrum of single cell behaviour and tissue
	packing in both 2D and 3D, by means of taking into account the typical
	core elements of cell surface mechanics, namely adhesion, cortical
	tension and volume conservation. We show that from an energy-based
	description forces and tensions can be derived and cell behaviour
	and tissue packing predicted, allowing for an intuitive, biologically
	relevant mapping between modelling and experiments. These predictions
	are confirmed by comparing them to the numerical outcomes of cell-packing
	geometries in a vertex-model proposed by Farhadifar et al. [2007]
	and 2D and 3D simulations of the Cellular Potts Model. The fact that
	the biological insights and qualitative cellular behaviours are in
	agreement even when such dierent model formalisms are being used
	illustrates the universality of energy-based approaches for cell
	surface mechanics.},
