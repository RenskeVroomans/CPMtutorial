## CPM tutorial

This tutorial uses a light-weight implementation of the Cellular Potts Model in C++.
There is no GUI, snapshots are produced as pngs in a separate folder. 
Installation instructions can be found in the exercises.pdf document, along with exercises to familiarise yourself with the model. 

The presentation folder contains the slides I used to teach the basics of CPM. 
The cpm_tutorial folder contains the code. Have fun!
